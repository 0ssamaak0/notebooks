    "\n",
    "- Causal language modeling: the model has to predict the next token in the sentence (so the labels are the same as the inputs shifted to the right). To make sure the model does not cheat, it gets an attention mask that will prevent it to access the tokens after token i when trying to predict the token i+1 in the sentence.\n",
